  In this paper, we designed and simulated a low power one bit, full adder circuits namely Novel 10T the adder are tested by using one bit ripple carry adder architecture.  The one bit Novel 10T,XOR/XNOR function technique has been used for the generation of full adders. The proposed design successfully works with the buffering circuit in the full adder design. All full adder circuits are design and analyse using 28nm Technology with 500 Mega Hertz frequency at 0.9 volt supply voltage. Due to lesser length requirement in the individual transistor, all the design of adders require lesser area as compared to existing design results in the tables. There is also improvement in terms of power, delay and power-delay product.

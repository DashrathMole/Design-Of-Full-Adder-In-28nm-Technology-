# Abstract <br/>
I designed and simulated a low power one bit, full adder circuits namely Novel 10T the adder.  The one bit Novel 10T,XOR/XNOR function technique has been used for the generation of full adders. The proposed design successfully works with the buffering circuit in the full adder design. All full adder circuits are design and analyse using 28nm Technology 1.8volt supply voltage. Due to lesser length requirement in the individual transistor, all the design of adders require lesser area as compared to existing design results in the tables. There is also improvement in terms of power, delay and power-delay product. Using  this 1bit  full adder we can design types of adder circuits 
# Tool used<br/>
*Synopsys Custom Compiler*:  The Synopsys Custom Compiler™ design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design. As the heart of the Synopsys Custom Design Platform, Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. This tool was used to design the circuit on a transistor level.<br/>
*Synopsys Primewave*:  PrimeWave™ Design Environment is a comprehensive and flexible environment for simulation setup and analysis of analog, RF, mixed-signal design, custom-digital and memory designs within the Synopsys Custom Design Platform. This tool helped in various types of simulations of the above designed circuit.<br/>
*Synopsys 28nm PDK*:  The Synopsys 28nm Process Design Kit(PDK) was used in creation and simulation of the above circuit design.<br/>
